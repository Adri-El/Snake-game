# Snake-game
This is the classic responsive snake game I built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
If you are using a laptop, press any of the arrow keys to start the game but if your are playing it on a mobile device, press any of the arrow keys to start the game.
the game ends when the snake hits a wall or intersects with it's self

The index.html is the file where the frame of the game was built
The style.css file contains the styling of the game
The game.js file is the main javaScript file that contains the function that kick starts the game
The snake.js file is the file that contains all the fuctions that controls the behaviour of the snake
The food.js file is the file that contains all the functions that controls the behaviour of the food
The grid.js file is the file that contains the function that has to do with the random positioning of the food in the grid system and it also contains the function that indicates if the head of the snake has collided with the frame of the game
The.input.js file contains all the event listeners
